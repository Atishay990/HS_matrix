• Looking at the sociological or economic analysis of professionals, engineering seems to qualify
only as a borderline profession.
 • Engineers have extensive training and possess knowledge and skills that are vital to the public.
However, engineers do not have anything like complete control of engineering services, at least in the
United States, because a license is not required to practice many types of engineering.
 • engineers who work in large organizations and are subject to the authority of managers and
employers may have limited autonomy.
 • engineering qualifies for at least quasi-professional status by the sociological account
