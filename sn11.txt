Business Model
• According to the business model, an occupation is primarily oriented toward making a profit
within the boundaries set by law. 
• They might choose to adopt the trappings of professionalism, but they would do so primarily
as a means to increase their income and protect themselves from governmental regulation.
• They would use their professional training and specialized knowledge that the layperson
does not have to impress upon laypeople that they deserve a high income and preferential
treatment.
• They would take advantage of the fact that they have knowledge that is important to
ordinary citizens to gain a monopoly or virtual monopoly over certain services in order to increase
profit and to persuade laypeople and governmental regulators that they should be granted a great
deal of autonomy in the workplace.
• They would promote the ideal of self-regulation in order to avoid close governmental
supervision by non-professionals.
• The major difference between the so-called professionals who adopt the business model
and most other occupations, such as sales or manufacturing, is that the latter seek profit primarily
by selling a physical product, such as automobiles or refrigerators, whereas professionals seek profit
by selling their expertise.
• Nevertheless, the ultimate goal is the same in both cases: selling something in the
marketplace for profit.
Professional Model
• Crucial to the professional model is the idea that engineers and other professionals have an
implicit trust relationship with the larger public. The terms of this trust relationship, sometimes
referred to as a ‘‘social contract’’ with the public, are that professionals agree to regulate their
practice so that it promotes the public good.
• That is, they agree to regulate themselves in accordance with high standards of technical
competence and ethical practice so that they do not take unfair advantage of the public.
• Finally, professionals may seek a monopoly or at least considerable control over the
provision of the services in which they are competent, but this is in order to protect the public from
incompetent providers. In return, the public confers on professionals a number of benefits.
• Professionals are accorded high social standing, a better than average income, and
considerable autonomy in the workplace. The public also pays for a considerable percentage of
professional education, at least at public universities.
• It is obvious that neither the business model nor the professional model, taken by
themselves, contains the whole truth about the actual practice of professionals.
