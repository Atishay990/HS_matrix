Austrian-born British philosopher Karl Popper (1902 – 98) proposed the idea of the existence of
three ‘worlds’:
• World 1, the world of physical objects, events and biological entities.
• World 2, the world of mental events and objects
• World 3, the world of products of the human mind, or abstract objects (theories, formulae,
learning). 
• Popper proposed that World 3 is partly autonomous from the other two, and that changes in
World 3 can impact on Worlds 1 and 2.
• Today, World 3 is sometimes used to talk about cyberspace and cyberculture, as an
emblematic abstract ‘mind-space’.
• Perhaps the major debate within the philosophy of science is what the methodology of
science amounts to or whether, in fact, it has a single, unifying methodology.
• This debate has been ongoing throughout the history of the philosophy of science. It started
with the inductivists.
• The founder of falsificationism, Karl Popper, took up the problems associated with
inductivism.
• Indeed, some philosophical problems track changes in natural science.
• How philosophers think about the mind and its place in nature, free will versus determinism,
the meaning of life, all are deeply affected by scientific developments, as science’s
descriptions of reality have changed over the centuries. Thus, the nature of the philosophical
problems has changed as well.
• Since science is arguably the only distinctive feature of western civilization that all the rest of
the world has taken up, understanding science is an important part of coming to grips with
the influence – whether good and bad – which it has had on other cultures.
• Philosophy has a better claim than other disciplines to be allowed to give an initial answer to
the question of what science consists of.
