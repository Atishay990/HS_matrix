COMMON MORALITY - • Common morality is the set of moral beliefs shared by almost
everyone. It is the basis, or at least the reference point, for the other two types of morality.
 • According to some moralists, common morality is designed primarily to protect individuals
from various types of violations or invasions of their personhood by others. I can violate your personhood by
killing you, lying to you, stealing from you, and so forth.
 PERSONAL MORALITY- • Personal ethics or personal morality is the set of moral beliefs that
a person holds. For most of us, our personal moral beliefs closely parallel the precepts of common morality.
 • However, our personal moral beliefs may differ from common morality in some areas,
especially where common morality seems to be unclear or in a state of change.
 PROFESSIONAL MORALITY /ETHICS - • Professional ethics is the set of standards adopted
by professionals insofar as they view themselves acting as professionals. Every profession has its
professional ethics: medicine, law, architecture, pharmacy, and so forth.
 • Unlike common morality and personal morality, professional ethics is usually stated in a
formal code.
 • The professional codes of ethics of a given profession focus on the issues that are important in
that profession.
 • When one is in a professional relationship, professional ethics is supposed to take precedence
over personal morality—at least ordinarily.
 • Professional ethics sometimes differs from personal morality in its degree of restriction of
personal conduct. Sometimes professional ethics is more restrictive than personal morality, and sometimes it
is less restrictive.
