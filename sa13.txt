But in 20th century period, after Second World War a new term erupted known as Neocolonialism. It
was a matter of confusion among sociologist as it was likewise colonialism. But later on, it was
concluded that neo-colonization is a practice where dominance is present but there is no direct
political leadership. For example, a poor country needs some money, and a rich country provides it

observed by Kwame Nkrumah, the former president of Ghana at the time when African countries
were getting out of Colonization.
Neo-colonization was the idea of controlling but it was also accounting for exploitation of nations in
place of development of poor countries. The only thing neo-colonization gave to society was more
under-development in the name of debts
