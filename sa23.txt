The Nebula Award for Best Novel is given each year by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of
America (SFWA) for science fiction or fantasy novels. A work of fiction is defined by the organization as a novel
if it is 40,000 words or longer; awards are also given out for pieces of shorter lengths in the categories of short
story, novelette, and novella. To be eligible for Nebula Award consideration a novel must be published in English
in the United States. Works published in English elsewhere in the world are also eligible provided they are
released on either a website or in an electronic edition
