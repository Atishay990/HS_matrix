◦ Information becomes increasingly important as the economic, cultural and political resources
upon which the emerging global information economy and information societies are organized, with the
majority of occupations based upon information or knowledge work.
 ◦ The dynamic innovation of ICTs is seen to be transforming the potential for processing, storing
and transmitting of information in ways previously unimaginable and ICTs are thereby becoming more
pervasive in our lives.
 ◦ Electronically networked economies and societies fundamentally transform our conceptions of
time and space, enabling information flows to transcend temporal and physical boundaries and thereby
facilitate processes of globalization and networking enterprise.
 ◦ Information becomes culturally more prevalent through multimedia applications, but also more
contested and less meaningful, in a world of competing, contradictory and constantly changing images, signs
and messages.
