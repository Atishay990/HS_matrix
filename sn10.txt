Cyber-libertarianism refers to the belief that individuals—acting in whatever capacity they choose
(as citizens, consumers, companies, or collectives)—should be at liberty to pursue their own
tastes and interests online.
Generally speaking, the cyber-libertarian’s motto is “Live & Let Live” and “Hands Off the
Internet!” The cyber-libertarian aims to minimize the scope of state coercion in solving social and
economic problems and looks instead to voluntary solutions and mutual consent-based
arrangements.
Cyberlibertarianism, broadly speaking, refers to a discourse that claims that the Internet and
related digital media technology can and should constitute spaces of individual liberty.
Liberty here is understood as non-interference such that individuals are able to act and
express themselves as they choose, and thus are self-governed, where interference is
understood as most readily emanating from governments but also at times from
corporations, particularly crony-capitalist ones. Various strands of this discourse have
developed over the last few decades. These strands differ in the weight that they place on
technology, markets, policy, and law for securing cyberspace as a space of, and for,
individual freedom.
The cyber-libertarian draws no distinction between social and economic freedom when applying
this vision:
 Social Freedom: Individuals should be granted liberty of conscience, thought, opinion,
speech, and expression in online environments.
 Economic Freedom: Individuals should be granted liberty of contract, innovation, and
exchange in online environments.
Cyber-libertarians also argue that social and economic freedoms are inextricably intertwined:
It is not enough to support liberty of action in one sphere; foreclosing freedom in one sphere
will eventually affect freedom in the other.
