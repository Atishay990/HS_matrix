◦ Netiquette is a set of commonly agreed standards of conduct, or rules of communication, that
operate within domains of cyberspace.
 ◦ Netiquette represents an attempt to lay down loose ‘rules’ governing behavior, and these are
necessarily evolving as cyberspace itself evolves.
 ◦ While these rules are seen by some people as evidence of emerging democracy online, for others
they show the exclusivity of virtual environments, especially in their use to police the behavior of
newcomers.
 ◦ A netizen is a citizen who employs the Internet for his or her activism or citizen of cyberspace.
 ◦ ‘Newbie’ is an online slang term for a newcomer, particularly someone with little technical
competence or knowledge of the rules and norms of a particular virtual forum.
