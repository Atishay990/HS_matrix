 Relationship between science and philosophy.
• What the history of science and the legacy of problems it leaves to philosophy shows is
that the two intellectual inquiries have always been inextricably linked. 
• One of the oddities about philosophy is that it seems to be a heterogeneous subject
without the unity that characterizes, say, economics, or chemistry.
• Among its subdisciplines, there is logic – the study of valid forms of reasoning, aesthetics
– the study of the nature of beauty, ethics and political philosophy which concern
themselves with the basis of moral value and justice, epistemology– the study of the
nature, extent and justification of knowledge, and metaphysics which seeks to identify the
fundamental kinds of things that really exist.
Philosophy deals with two sets of questions:
• First, the questions that science – physical, biological, social, behavioral – cannot answer
now and perhaps may never be able to answer.
• Second, the questions about why the sciences cannot answer the first lot of questions.
The special place of science as a source of objective knowledge raises questions about how it
secures such knowledge and whether there are alternative sources or means of securing it.
Because it has always provided an influential description of reality, science has historically been
the most influential force on the shape of pressing philosophical problems.
