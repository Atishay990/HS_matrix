Worldviews are ways of seeing and interpreting the world from a cultural perspective that provide
the tools to categorize and classify the world.
 If your worldview is based on using technology, you may categorize a new digital technology for
viewing movies based upon clarity of the picture, price, availability, and so on.
 However, if you are the designer of the technology, your categories may overlap with the user and
will include additional categories overlooked by the “average” user, such as speed of transmission,
resolution, cost of manufacturing, and development time.
 When we categorize objects, people, or ideas we generally do so using a binary system: good/bad,
male/female, hard/soft, technical/ nontechnical and so on.
 Two elementary divisions that all cultures use are male/female and young/old. These are
categories that originate in our experiences as human beings and our interactions with others.
 As these labels are used repeatedly by a community, they create a common culture, common
experiences and common interpretations of events, ideas, and people – worldviews.
 Once the labels are well established, they reflect the worldview  and system of organizing used by
the community.
 When something is out of place in the worldview, it is called “dirt”, signaling that a boundary or
classification has been transgressed.
 Social theorists pay attention to worldviews, classification, boundaries and dirt because they
provide insights into how the social world works.
 By studying people who embrace or reject technology, we can learn about technology’s role in
the community.
 We can highlight, analyze, contextualize, understand, and alter our relationships to science and
technology by situating them historically, culturally, and socially.
