• ACCOUNTABILITY TO CLIENTS & CUSTOMERS: Although an engineer’s primary
responsibility is to protect public safety, the engineer should also perform tasks for the client or company
responsibly.
 • FAIR TREATMENT: Engineers are entitled to a fair work environment. Employees are entitled
to an environment where treatment is based on merit (nondiscrimination) and ethnic, sexual, and age
harassment are not tolerated. Company policies should be spelled out in an employee handbook.
 • PRINCIPLE OF INFORMED CONSENT: The principle of informed consent refers to the right
of each individual potentially affected by a project to participate to an appropriate degree in decision making
concerning that project. Returning to the Challenger explosion example, the astronauts should have been
informed of the possibility of O-ring failure before the Challenger launch occurred.
 • CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Conflict of interest refers to the potential to distort good judgment
while serving more than one employer or client. When this potential exists, an engineer should openly admit
to these relationships in order to prevent impropriety.
