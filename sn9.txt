When people think about technophobia most people think of fear of computers, this
would be correct, however this is only the surface. Jay defines it as ‘a resistance to
talking about computers or even thinking about computers; fear or anxiety towards
computers; hostile or aggressive thoughts about computers’ There was further evidence
to support these views in Brosnan’s book (1998, p. 13) supporting the views of Rosen and
Weil (1990, cited in Brosnan, 1998, p.13) explaining that technophobia includes, ‘anxiety
about current or future interactions with computers or computer related technology’ that
there are ‘negative global attitudes about computers’ and ‘specific negative cognitions of
self-critical internal dialogues during computer interaction’ Technophobia relates to
many people across the spectrum.
So it is clear that technophobia, did not come around with the age of computers, but has
been around for a long time. It states that in ‘1965’, people were destroying machines as
they had a fear they would take over their livelihoods.
It came as a shock that Technophobia could be passed on unconsciously from teachers to
students. If teachers show a fear or dislike towards computers, this can have an effect on
children, making it clear that children can be technophobes.
Technophobia comes in many different levels, mild, moderate and extreme. Wienberg
and Fuerst’s (1984) study states that as many as twenty five per cent of people in their
study, were mildly technophobic, and estimated as many as five per cent of people
suffered from extreme technophobia
