The university framework promotes democracy, dissent, openness, discussion and debate
or‘indiscipline within discipline’. HSS disciplines are nourished in non-hierarchical, democratic
organisational frameworks that are not highly structured in terms of time. The scope for such interaction is
often reduced in technology institutes that are necessarily more regimented and structured.
 Institutes imagine themselves as places for highly specialised training and knowledge production.
 The institute has to re- imagine itself as a university where the unity of knowledge is
maintained. This implies creating the space for various kinds of freedoms – the freedom to
read, think, research and teach in our respective disciplines. The space for dissent too, has to
be there. Although such institutes imagine themselves as being free of ideology, it is well
know that, in general, they tend to be repositories of conservative ideologies. This is clearly
seen in the understated but well-known presence of sizable numbers of faculty members of
several IITs showing allegiance to right-wing parties and groups.
