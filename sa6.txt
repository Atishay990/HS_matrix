Science is an Adventure, it is marvelous, it is not retrograde,
 Science is pragmatic, it is unpredictable, it is utilitarian,
 Conservative and revolutionary, not skepticism,
 Science is not hierarchical, it is cooperative, it is universal,
 Science is societyâ€™s heritage of common knowledge.
 (P.S. To elaborate each point refer to pdf named SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY)
