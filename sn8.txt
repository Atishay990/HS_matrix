◦ E-Commerce is a generic term used to describe the buying
and selling of goods via the Internet and other interactive
networks such as digital television. ◦ The advantages of ecommerce are obvious. Growth in the sector was initially
limited by a lack of consumer confidence. ◦ Capitalism has
always been constrained by logistics, shops can only be of a
certain size, only in so many different places and only
offering a limited range of goods and services. ◦ Electronic
commerce is viewed by some as ‘capitalism unbound’, a 
potentially perfect marketplace, in which the buyer has
access to the whole globe and can use intelligent agents to
shop around in search of the best possible product for the
best possible price.
