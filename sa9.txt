 On February 28, 1953, James Watson of the United States and Francis Crick of England made one
of the greatest scientific discoveries in history. The two scientists found the double-helix structure of DNA.
It’s made up of two strands that twist around each other and have an almost endless variety of chemical
patterns that create instructions for the human body to follow. Our genes are made of DNA and determine
how things like what color hair and eyes we’ll have. In 1962, they were awarded the Nobel Prize for this
work. The discovery has helped doctors understand diseases and may someday prevent some illnesses like
heart disease and cancer.

3.
Wilhelm Roentgen, a German physicist, discovered X-rays in 1895. X-rays go right through some
substances, like flesh and wood, but are stopped by others, such as bones and lead. This allows them to be
used to see broken bones or explosives inside suitcases, which makes them useful for doctors and security
officers. For this discovery, Roentgen was awarded the first-ever Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.
